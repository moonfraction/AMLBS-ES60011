# Project 4: Neural Network Implementation

## Overview
This project involves the implementation of a neural network using the `NN.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. The notebook demonstrates the creation, training, and evaluation of a neural network model for a specific dataset.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
2. The dataset should be present in the same directory as the notebook.
2. The second last cell when run prompts for input of the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the learning rate and the number of K-fold cross validation. The user may enter the desired value.

## Results
The results of the neural network training and evaluation will be displayed within the notebook, including performance metrics which is the mean squared error and visualizations of the training error with epoches.
